# Java 11
# Spring Boot 2.7.0

*Note- Due to latest Spring Boot 2.7.0, there is a bug in Swagger 3.0 thats why cant implement in this project but I am working on it.*

As a fresher, I gave my 100% to build this application in backend (JAVA) as well as frontend  (Angular).I developed my own logic without taking any help from outside not even youtube ,yes stackoverflow was there for me,the programmers best friend, that's why project may look like written in long codes. I foucused more on designing the page.
I worked with JAVA technologies as Spring Boot, Hibernate, Project Lombok etc to build backend. And MySQL as database.For frontend , I used Angular to mostly
focused on SPA.
I didn't get that much time to integrate User or Customer and Admin or Seller feature as I want do it properly by using Spring Security,JWT,BCrypt Password technology.
Saving TVs product is currently under process.

To Start the application ,just download both repos frontend and backend and update both the project.For saving product image I gave my path but you have to give its your own asset folder path by changing path from Application.properties.Remember you have to give Asset folder path of Angular Project.No doubt an experienced player make this app in less lines of code but that's why he is experienced.

Currently you can fetch all products,  
fetch product  
by searching its name,  
*by price,  
by category,  
by product type.  
You can add your products too.*
